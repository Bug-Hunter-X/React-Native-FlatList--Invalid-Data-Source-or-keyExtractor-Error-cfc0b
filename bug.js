This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an invalid or improperly formatted data source.  The data source should be an array of objects, where each object represents an item to be rendered.  Common mistakes include providing a null or undefined value, or an array of primitive data types instead of objects.  For example, `data: [1, 2, 3]` is incorrect; it should be `data: [{ key: '1', value: 1 }, { key: '2', value: 2 }, { key: '3', value: 3 }]`. Also, ensure that the `keyExtractor` function is correctly implemented to uniquely identify each item in the data source. If you are using the key prop directly, then make sure it is also unique and of string type.
